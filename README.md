Micro Message Hub
===
Pragmatic and opinionated messaging solution for your (micro) services, backed by AMQP.

Why should you be interested?
---
Micro message hub is not just a library, it's also the architecture skeleton for your application.

As a library it offers you a nice API, hiding AMQP complexity, exposing just the fine grained selection
of features and also a test doubles for easy testing your components in isolation.

As an architecture, it offers a battle tested communication scheme for your modules, often written in
different languages. It's based on AMQP (using RabbitMQ extension), so anything having a proper driver would work.

**More to come...**

You are welcome
